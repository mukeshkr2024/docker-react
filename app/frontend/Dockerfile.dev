# Step 1: Build the React app
FROM node:18 as build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Build the application (creates the dist/ directory with the static files)
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Serve the app with NGINX
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build files from the previous step to the NGINX directory
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to be accessible from outside the container
EXPOSE 80

# Use the default NGINX configuration (you can customize it if needed)
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
